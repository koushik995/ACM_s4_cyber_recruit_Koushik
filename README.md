# My Interest

I am interested in Cybersecurity because I enjoy analyzing files, networks, and hidden data patterns to understand how systems work internally. It also challenges the way I think. I am fascinated about the investigative mode of Cybersecurity, as we should give attention to every detail. It requires logical thinking, patience to check every detail.

Through this recruitment CTF, I was able to explore aspects such as file inspection, encoding techniques, metadata analysis of files, and problem-solving. While I successfully solved some challenges, I also faced difficulties in others, which helped me recognize areas where I need to improve. This motivated me to strengthen my basics and continue to learn more about cybersecurity.
